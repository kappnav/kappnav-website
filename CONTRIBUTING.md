# kAppNav contributing guidelines

Welcome to the kAppNav community!

You can contribute to the project in a variety of ways:
- Fixing or reporting bugs
- Improve documentation
- Contribute code

We welcome all contributions to the kAppNav project and request you follow the guidelines below:

## Code of conduct

All members of the kAppNav community must abide by the
[Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). Only by respecting each other can we
develop a productive, collaborative community.

## Raising issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to raise a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.

Check that the list of project issues doesn't already include that problem or request before submitting an issue. If you find a matching issue, add a "+1" or comment indicating that you have the same issue, as this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

A good bug report is one that make it easy for everyone to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.

## Pull requests

If you're working on an existing issue, simply respond to the issue and express
interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is
active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

To submit a proposed change:

- Fork the affected repository.
- Create a new branch for your changes.
- Develop the code/fix.
- Modify the documentation as necessary.
- Verify all CI status checks pass, and work to make them pass if failing.

The general rule is that all PRs should be 100% complete - meaning they should
include documentation changes related to the change. A
significant exception is work-in-progress PRs. These should be indicated by opening a draft pull request. To open a draft pull request, click the dropdown arrow that appears next to the “Create pull request” button and then select the "Create draft pull request" option.

## Contributor License Agreement

In order for us to merge any of your changes into kAppNav, you need to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/kappnav/kappnav-website). When you open up a Pull Request for the first time, a bot will comment with a link to the CLA.

## Merge approval and release process

A maintainer may add "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me) or an equivalent comment to indicate that a PR is acceptable. Any change requires at least one LGTM. No pull requests can be merged until at least one maintainer signs off with an LGTM.
